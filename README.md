# School District Analysis

## SCHOOL DISTRICT ANALYSIS OVERVIEW

The purpose of this project is to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. This is due to evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. The initial data analysis was performed on a city school district standardized test for analysis about performance trends to inform discussions and decisons at the school and district level. This involved analyzing data on student funding and student standardized test scores to aggregate data and showcase trends in school performance. The tasks assinged are as follows:

* >*How is the district summary affected?*
* >*How is the school summary affected?*
* >*How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?*
* >*How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following; math and reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, scores by school type*
